Part of the framework for an alignment algorithm that's supposed to find the
minimum-penalty alignment of two graphs (node-for-node) where the score
function is only a function of information stored on the nodes, not the edges
themselves (but it is not allowed for the edges to be rearranged in the
consensus graph, only for gap nodes to be inserted). It's meant to generalize
algorithms such as Smith-Waterman and Needleman-Wunsch to any graph, not just
lines. I never finished it, because it was hard.
